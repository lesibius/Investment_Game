# Workflow

As my Windows laptop recently died, I am creating this app through my Ubuntu laptop. Unfortunately, mono does not support the System.Worklow namespace and as the olive project seems inactive for a couple of years, I decided to create my own workflow.

This would be my first application using a workflow, so I will code it as I imagine a workflow should be done, which will be probably deviate (a lot) from the best practices.
